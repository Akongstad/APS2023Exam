Input
The input consists of a sequence of lines. 
The last line of input is empty and should not be processed. 
Each line of input other than the last contains at least one 
but no more than one thousand uppercase letters and spaces. 
The spaces are irrelevant and should be ignored.

Note that the last line of the sample input is a blank line.

Output
For each line of input, output a sequence of lines, 
giving the number of repetitions of words of length 1, 2, 3, 
and so on. When you reach a length such that there are no repeated words 
of that length, output one blank line, 
do not output anything further for that input line, 
and move on to the next line of input.

Note that the last line of the sample output is a blank line.
